# numpy_depth_showcase
Method to mimic a MiDaS-style depth-from-image demo without machine learning, using transparent NumPy steps. It involves loading and normalizing an image, computing feature maps, generating a heuristic depth blend, regularizing, computing gradients, and converting the depth map into coordinate grids for 3D visualization.
